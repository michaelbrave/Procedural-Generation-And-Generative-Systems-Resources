# The Future of Art Resources

This document is my attempt at organizing as many of the resources about any thing I feel is relevant or related to the study of using computers to make things either independent of human input or collaboratively with it. My particular background is that of a graphic designer turned programmer focusing on making games, but I hope that this will grow beyond my own personal experience and bias.

I believe generative design combined with AI will shift the world in much the same way as the printing press, and that like the pc became "the bicycle of the mind", I think this field will be what gives the future of art an engine.

If you have proposed edits don't hesitate to get in touch or do a pull request and I'll take care of it as quickly as I can.

Some of the categories are as follows

Primarily this is focused on Procedural Generation but I will also focus on

Core Area of Focus:
  Media Synthesis
  Non Computer Based Procedural Generation
  AI Art
  Computational Art & Creative Coding
  Generative Design

General Technologies:
  Algorithms
  Deep Learning & Machine Learning
  Shaders
  The Demoscene

Bordering Fields:
  Game Design
  User Experience and Human Computer Interaction
  Data Visualization
  Interactive Narrative
  Dynamic Generation

and I'm sure more that have yet to be invented or that I have not yet learned about
