# Procedural-Generation-Resources

This document is my attempt at organizing as many of the resources about procedural generation and all related fields in one place. Due to this being an emerging field I have also included other fields like; Generative Art, AI Art, Creative Coding, Computational Creativity, Robot Assisted Creation, Generative Design, Game AI, Human Computer Interaction, Interactive Narrative, Intelligent Narratives, Automated Storytelling Technology, Algorithmic Content, and any other thing I feel is relevant or related to the study of using computers to make things either independent of human input or collaboratively with it. My particular background is in art and game design so my initial leanings will have a bit of bias in the information I gather, but I hope that as others see where my resource is lacking they will tell me so that I can improve it, and fix the shortcomings.

I believe generative design will be the killer app of AI, and that like the pc became "the bicycle of the mind", I think this field will be what gives it an engine.

If you have proposed edits don't hesitate to get in touch or do a pull request and I'll take care of it as quickly as I can.

Some of the categories are as follows

Core Areas:
Procedural Generation
Non Computer Based Procedural Generation
AI Art
Computational Art & Creative Coding
Generative Design

General Technologies:
Algorithms
Deep Learning & Machine Learning

Bordering Fields:
Game Design
User Experience and Human Computer Interaction
Data Visualization
Interactive Narrative

and I'm sure more that have yet to be invented or that I have not yet learned about
