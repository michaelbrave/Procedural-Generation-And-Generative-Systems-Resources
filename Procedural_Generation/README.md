# Procedural Generation 

## Definition

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation) "procedural generation is a method of creating data algorithmically as opposed to manually, typically through a combination of human-generated assets and algorithms coupled with computer-generated randomness and processing power"

But for many the simplest definition is that "procedural is the opposite of handmade" or as others would say "the method of creating algorithmically".

## Context

Procedrual Generation in it's current form is mostly used in interactive media like Video Games, but has a long history of using processes, techniques and rulesets to create anything from art to music to archictecture. Any type of creation that uses a process or has rules can utilize these techniques.
